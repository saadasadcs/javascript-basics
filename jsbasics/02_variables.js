const id = 70109951   

let name = "Saadiee" // best approach is, use the let keyword to declare a variable, you can overwrite the value but cannot declared a variable with same name again

var email = "saadiee@gmail.com"

city = "Lahore" // by default type of variable consider as var 

// id = 70109453 not allowed as the keyword is const only declared once 


console.log(id);

console.table([id,name,email,city]);
